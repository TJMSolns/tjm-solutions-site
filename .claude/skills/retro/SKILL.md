Run a structured retrospective.

## Steps

### 1. Load context

Read:
- `docs/agents/HANDOFF-LEDGER.md` — all entries since the last retro
- `docs/agents/LESSONS-LEARNED.md` — existing entries (to avoid duplication; create if missing)
- `docs/agents/CONTEXT-KERNEL.md` — current non-negotiables (to check if any need updating)
- `docs/governance/POL/` — existing policies (to check for gaps)

### 2. Summarize the period

Present to the user:
- Number of WQ items completed since last retro
- Any open decisions that are still unresolved
- Any recurring patterns or themes in recent handoffs

### 3. Ask structured questions (one at a time, wait for response)

**Q1 — Process:** Were there any friction points in how we worked? Anything that slowed things down or caused rework?

**Q2 — Architecture:** Any design decisions from this period you'd make differently now? Any non-negotiable that turned out to be wrong or too restrictive?

**Q3 — Governance gaps:** Were there situations where we lacked a POL and had to make ad-hoc calls?

**Q4 — Tooling:** Any improvements needed to agents, skills, or hooks?

### 4. For each finding, produce the right artifact

| Finding type | Action |
|---|---|
| New standing rule | Use `/decide pol <title>` pattern |
| ADR that needs updating | Flag for review — do not auto-edit |
| CONTEXT-KERNEL non-negotiable change | Propose the edit; do not write until confirmed |
| Process improvement | Write to LESSONS-LEARNED |
| Tooling improvement | Write to LESSONS-LEARNED; open WQ item if implementation needed |
| Informational | Write to LESSONS-LEARNED |

### 5. Append to LESSONS-LEARNED

For each finding worth preserving, append an LL-NNN entry to `docs/agents/LESSONS-LEARNED.md`:
```markdown
## LL-<NNN> — <date> — <short title>
**Finding:** <what was learned>
**Action taken:** <POL created / WQ item added / no action>
```

### 6. Append retro summary to HANDOFF-LEDGER

```markdown
## HL-NNN — Retrospective <date>
**Items reviewed:** <WQ IDs or "site-level">
**Findings:** <N> (<N with action>, <N informational>)
**Artifacts produced:** <list>
**Next retro:** <suggested date>
```

### 7. Report

Print a brief summary: period covered, finding count, artifacts produced, any open decisions that remain unresolved.
